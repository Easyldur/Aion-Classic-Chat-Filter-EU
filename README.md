# Aion-Classic-Chat-Filter-NA

This is Aion chat filter data for the NA Aion Classic Client to combat in-game kinah bot spam. If any bot spam makes it through the latest version of the filter, feel free to make a pull request adding new criteria for the filter. I am not terribly active on Github, so if you make a pull request please notify me via Discord: Yon#7259.

To add this to your client, download the whole repository and merge the AION_CLASSIC folder from this repository with the one for your installation of Aion Classic. More detailed installation instructions may become available at a later date.
