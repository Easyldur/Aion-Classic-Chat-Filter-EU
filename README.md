# Aion-Classic-Chat-Filter-EU

This is a chat filter data file for the EU Gameforge Aion Classic Client intended to combat in-game kinah bot spam.  
The original was made by Yores https://github.com/Yoress/Aion-Classic-Chat-Filter-NA I'm just trying to adapt it to Classic Europe

This filter is just a built-in feature of the Aion Client; it is a text file that adds keywords to filter out of chat and private shops. You can edit this file with any simple text editor such as Notepad (built-in to Windows) and add any keywords you want; however, because Gameforge added their version of this filter to a pak file, we must do the same -- for ease of editing, this repository's pak file is not XOR'd and is merely a PK Zip file in disguise.
